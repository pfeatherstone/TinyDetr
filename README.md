# TinyDetr #

If you like tiny code, Pytorch and Detr, then you'll like TinyDetr.

## What this is ##

* An experimental library on Detr style architectures using "tiny-oriented programming". 
* The objective is to implement the simplest Transformer architecture that trains reasonably quickly, with reasonable memory (ideally 1 maybe 2 commodity GPUs), and can run real-time on commodity hardware (CPU, GPU, Apple Silicon, etc).
* This does not implement standard published architectures.
